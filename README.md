The best way to practice rolling your own authentication is do to it with multiple apps. Authentication will be a requirement for your first major project, so let's get some practice today.

You will be adding authentication to your Ritly project from last week. You will probably need to heavily refer to your notes from earlier today.

Authentication: https://github.com/wdi-sf-jan-2014/notes/blob/master/user_auth/UserSessionsAndAuth.md

It will need to have the following features:

Sign in Page
Sign Up page
Sign out button
User Page (like a profile)
A secure password, please
Session, so system knows who I am during visit.
User Model
Remember token in Users Model
Sessions Helper


FEATURES TO ADD:
- fix edit links and iframe
- don't duplicate urls
- Make the preview or url show page contain the number of times someone has used that redirect.
- Allow the user creating the redirect to give a string to use as the shortened string. (localhost:3000/go/my_string redirects to my_url). Make sure to think about possible problems this could cause.
- Make everything gorgeous.
- do custom rit


QUESTIONS:
- does preview variable have to be same as redirect variable since it is linking to that?
- http or https?
- why does iframe not work
- why does edit page not work






patch or get on go method?
